Jeroen Massar
- Revision v2.4b2-to-IPv6
   - Added IPv6 support.
   - Added -I option for selecting source IPv4/IPv6 address.
   - Makefile.in now generates a Makefile which will build both 
     fping (IPv4) and fping6 (IPv6). Thus it makes an fping (IPv4 only)
     and an fping6 (IPv6 only).
   - num_unreachable was counted twice when a sendto() generated errors.
   - See http://unfix.org/projects/ipv6/

Jason Ewasiuk <jasone@remote.net>
- Revision v2.4b1
	- added -g option for generating IPs from a start to an end value
		- two available options, generate IPs from start IP to end IP
		  or from a passed netmask, such as 192.168.1.0/24

Jason Ewasiuk <jasone@remote.net>
- Revision v2.3b1
	- formatting changes to code layout (fping.c)
	NOTE:  Best viewed with a tab stop of 4
	- merged in changes from Debian c/o Herbert Xu
	<herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
		- Compilation fix on alphas with glibc
		- Alignment issues (note from JE:  in wait_for_reply())
		- A typo with the time specified on the command line
		(note from JE:  bug was using 10 instead of 100)
		- Drop privileges after obtaining socket
		(note from JE:  might be moot, since prog exits if
		user is not root)
	- touched all files in package to this date
	- couple new #ifdefs added for future WIN32 support
	(Haven't got to adding this yet, will take a lot of rewriting.)

	* stop using sys_errlist and start using strerror
	fixed bug in output of -C

Wed Jan  8 11:18:37 1997  Roland Schemers  <schemers@stanford.edu>

	* Created ChangeLog file. What follows was from the CHANGES file.

* Revision 2.0  1994/10/31 21:26:23 morgan

  Substantial rewrite, including new features:

    support some traditional ping features:
      loop mode
      specify size of data packets
      specify how many pings to send
      show per-response data
      interpret ICMPs other than ICMP Echo response

  also

    rewrote main loop completely
    make timings in tenths of milliseconds
    do exponential backoff on retries
    port to more systems
    add some debugging stuff
    do better checking on whether received ICMP is for us

* Revision 1.24  1993/12/10  23:11:39  schemers

  commented out seteuid(getuid()) since it isn't needed

* Revision 1.23  1993/12/10  18:33:41  schemers

  Took out the -f option for non-root users. This can be enabled by
  defining ENABLE_F_OPTION before compiling. There is a call to
  access before opening the file, but there is a race condition.
  Reading from stdin is much safer.


* Revision 1.22  1993/11/16  19:49:24  schemers

  Took out setuid(getuid()) and used access() system call to
  check for access to the file specified with "-f".
 
* Revision 1.21  1993/07/20  18:08:19  schemers

  commented out the test to make sure the ping packet came from the
  same IP address as the one we sent to. This could cause problems on
  multi-homed hosts.

* Revision 1.20  1993/02/23  00:16:38  schemers

fixed syntax error (should have compiled before checking in...)

* Revision 1.19  1993/02/23  00:15:15  schemers

turned off printing of "is alive" when -a is specified.

* Revision 1.18  1992/07/28  15:16:44  schemers

added a fflush(stdout) call before the summary is sent to stderr, so
everything shows up in the right order.

* Revision 1.17  1992/07/23  03:29:42  schemers
* Revision 1.16  1992/07/22  19:24:37  schemers

Fixed declaration of timeval_diff. Didn't notice the problem because
I use 'cc' in stead of gcc under Ultrix. Time to switch? :-)

Modified file reaing so it would skip blank lines or lines starting
with a '#'. Now you can do something like:

fping -ad < /etc/hosts

* Revision 1.15  1992/07/21  17:07:18  schemers

Put in sanity checks so only root can specify "dangerous" options.
Changed usage to show switchs in alphabetical order.
* Revision 1.14  1992/07/21  16:40:52  schemers
* Revision 1.13  1992/07/17  21:02:17  schemers

Changed the default timeout to 2500 msec, and retry to 3. This was
due to suggestions from people with slow (WAN) networks. The default
1 sec timeout was too fast.


Added '-e' option for showing elapsed (round-trip) times on pakets, and
modified the -s option to include min, max, and average round-trip times,
and over all elapsed time.

Modified action taken when a error is returned from sendto. The action
taken now considers the host unreachable and prints the hostname 
followed by the errno message. The program will not exit and will continue
to try other hosts.

* Revision 1.12  1992/07/17  16:38:54  schemers
* Revision 1.11  1992/07/17  16:28:38  schemers

 move socket create call so I could do a setuid(getuid()) before the
 fopen call is made. Once the socket is created root privs aren't needed
 to send stuff out on it.

 moved num_timeout counter. It really was for debug purposes and didn't
 make sense to the general public :-) Now it is the number of timeouts
 (pings that didn't get received with the time limit).


* Revision 1.10 1992/07/16  16:24:38  schemers
* Revision 1.9  1992/07/16  16:00:04  schemers
* Revision 1.8  1992/07/16  05:44:41  schemers

Added _NO_PROTO stuff for older compilers, and _POSIX_SOURCE
for unistd.h, and _POSIX_SOURCE for stdlib.h. Also added
check for __cplusplus.

Now compiles ok under Ultrix 3.1, and Sun4 using cc. Also compiled
ok using g++ 2.2.2.

Changed '-a' and '-u' flags to be mutually exclusive (makes sense, since
specifiying both '-a' and '-u' is the same as not specifiying anything.
Since '-a' and '-u' are mutually exclusive, these options now only print
the hostname, and not the 'is alive' or 'is unreachable'  messages.
This makes it much easier to do stuff like:

#!/usr/local/bin/perl
$hosts_to_backup=`cat /etc/hosts.backup|fping -a`;

Since you don't have to strip off the 'is alive' messages.

Changed usage to and stats to print to stderr instead of stdout.
