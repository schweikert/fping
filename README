fping 3 README
--------------
fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar to ping,
but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts. fping has a long long
story: Roland Schemers did publish a first version of it in 1992 and it has
established itself since then as a standard tool.

Installation
------------
If you want to install fping from source, proceed as follows:

1. Run ./configure with the correct arguments
   (see: ./configure --help)

2. Run make; make install

3. Make fping either setuid, or, if under Linux:

   sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep fping

4. Have a look at the fping(8) manual for usage help
   (fping -h will also give a minimal help output)


IPv6 support
------------
You can can compile fping with support for IPv6 addresses. A separate binary
is used for that, called fping6. To build it, use ./configure --enable-ipv6
(possibly combined with --enable-ipv4 to also build fping for IPv4). E.g.:

  # ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-ipv4 --enable-ipv6
  # make
  # make install
  # sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /usr/local/bin/fping*
