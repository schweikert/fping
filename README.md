# fping

fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar to ping,
but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts. fping has a long long
story: Roland Schemers did publish a first version of it in 1992 and it has
established itself since then as a standard tool.

## Installation

If you want to install fping from source, proceed as follows:

0. Run ./autogen.sh
   (only needed if you got the source code by cloning a git repository)
1. Run ./configure with the correct arguments
   (see: ./configure --help)
2. Run make; make install
3. Make fping either setuid, or, if under Linux:
   sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep fping
4. Have a look at the fping(8) manual for usage help
   (fping -h will also give a minimal help output)

## Usage

See: [fping man-page](doc/fping.pod)
