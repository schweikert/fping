# fping

fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts, similar to ping,
but much better performing when pinging multiple hosts. fping has a long long
story: Roland Schemers did publish a first version of it in 1992 and it has
established itself since then as a standard tool.

## Installation

If you want to install fping from source, proceed as follows:

0. Run `./autogen.sh`
   (only if you got the source from Github).
1. Run `./configure` with the correct arguments.
   (see: `./configure --help`)
2. Run `make; make install`.
3. Make fping either setuid, or, if under Linux:
   `sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep fping`

If you can't run fping as root or can't use the cap_net_raw capability, you can
also run fping in unprivileged mode. This works on MacOS and also on Linux,
provided that your GID is included in the range defined in
`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range`. This is particularly useful for running
fping in rootless / unprivileged containers. The --fwmark option needs root or 
cap_net_admin. setuid will not work for --fwmark.

## Usage

Have a look at the [fping(8)](doc/fping.pod) manual page for usage help.
(`fping -h` will also give a minimal help output.)
